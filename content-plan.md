## Blog 1: "Your Arabic Contract Says Something Different. Would You Even Know?"

**Pain point:** Expats sign dual-language employment contracts where the Arabic version says something completely different from the English one. MOHRE only recognises the Arabic version in disputes. People discover this after it's too late.

**Source:** The National (UAE) documented a case: "the English one talks about commission and bonuses, whereas the Arabic one only has a basic salary." MOHRE uses the Arabic version exclusively in court.

**Secondary keywords:** `mohre contract language`, `employment contract arabic english difference`
**Target audience:** Expat employees, HR managers, business owners

3. Three things that commonly differ: salary, notice period, benefits

## Blog 2: "You Paid for a Certified Translation. You Got Google Translate."

**Pain point:** People pay AED 200-500 for "certified" translations that turn out to be machine-translated garbage. Documents get rejected. Money wasted.

**Source:** Trustpilot 1-star review (Oct 2025): "they charge you for certified sworn translations and they give you chats gpt translations." Another reviewer paid GBP 210 for "documents that are unusable and fraudulent."

**Secondary keywords:** `moj certified translator`, `google translate arabic problems`
**Target audience:** Anyone buying translation services for the first time
**Word count:** 500-700

3. What a real certified translation looks like (3 elements: MOJ stamp, QR, registration number)
4. OnlineTranslation.ae guarantee: human translator, verifiable credentials

## Blog 3: "Why RTA Rejected Your Driving License Translation (and the Fix)"

**Pain point:** People get their foreign driving license translated, go to RTA, and get rejected. Either the translation wasn't from an MOJ-approved translator, or the name transliteration doesn't match their Emirates ID.

**Source:** Trustpilot review (Tom Farkas): "First they cheated me with the price. (Tripled it! For a single plastic card's translation...) Then they didn't even meet the deadline." Translation was "not at all suitable for applying for a Dubai driving license."

**Target keyword:** `driving license translation dubai` / `rta license conversion translation`
**Secondary keywords:** `convert foreign driving license uae`, `driving license arabic translation`
**Target audience:** New UAE residents converting foreign licenses
**Word count:** 500-600
**CTA:** Upload your license. We match the name transliteration to your Emirates ID. AED [X] flat rate.

**Outline:**
1. Open with the Trustpilot story — tripled price, missed deadline, rejected anyway
2. Why RTA rejects: name mismatch, wrong translator, missing stamp

## Blog 4: "One Misspelled Name Held Up My UAE Visa for Weeks"

**Pain point:** Visa applications rejected because the translated name doesn't match the passport spelling exactly. One wrong letter = resubmission, weeks of delay.

**Source:** Legal translation firms document this as a top rejection reason. Fragomen (immigration law firm) confirmed Dubai now requires Arabic translations for all supporting documents — English-only no longer accepted.

**Target keyword:** `visa translation dubai` / `visa document translation uae`
**Secondary keywords:** `visa application rejected translation`, `gdrfa document requirements`
**Target audience:** Visa applicants (employment, family, golden)
**Word count:** 500-600
**CTA:** We cross-check every translated name against your passport before delivery.

**Outline:**
1. Open: one letter off — weeks of delay (real scenario pattern)
2. Why it happens: Arabic transliteration has multiple valid spellings for foreign names
3. GDRFA's rule: translated names must match passport exactly
4. What we do differently: passport cross-check before delivery
5. Close: "We've never had a name-mismatch rejection."

## Blog 5: "Your Restaurant Menu Says 'Bathroom Soup' in Arabic"

**Source:** Industry Arabic documented 20 real fails. Gulf News reported Dubai Municipality warning letters to 900+ restaurants. "Bathroom soup" = pigeon (حمام) vs bathroom (حمّام) — one diacritical mark difference.

**Target audience:** Restaurant owners, F&B businesses, retail shops

## Blog 7: "Stop Overpaying at Typing Centers for Translation"

**Pain point:** Typing centers near government offices charge location-based premiums. Same translation costs AED 50-80 in Deira vs AED 100-150 in Marina. Hidden fees for "project management," rush, formatting. Multiple trips if corrections needed.

**Source:** Pricing comparisons across UAE typing centers. Industry sources: "I have had clients saying 'it's a really simple bank statement, how can it cost so much?'"

**Target keyword:** `translation cost dubai` / `cheap translation dubai`
**Secondary keywords:** `typing center translation price`, `online translation uae`
**Target audience:** Cost-conscious expats, anyone comparing prices

## Blog 8: "Golden Visa Translation Costs Nobody Warned You About"

**Pain point:** Golden Visa applicants budget for the AED 4,000 application fee but don't realise they need 5-10 documents translated at AED 100-500 each. Total translation cost: AED 1,000-1,500 on top of everything else.

**Source:** Immigration cost breakdowns cite "$1,000-$1,500 in additional costs" for translations. Uncertified translations = rejection.

**Target keyword:** `golden visa translation uae` / `golden visa documents dubai`

**Word count:** 500-700

## Blog 9: "Your Lawyer's Translation Got Rejected by Dubai Courts. Now What?"

**Pain point:** People bring translations done abroad or by non-MOJ translators. Dubai Courts reject them regardless of accuracy. They have to pay again for a UAE MOJ-certified version.

3. The three things Dubai Courts check: MOJ stamp, QR code, translator registration

## Blog 10: "Your Bank Rejected Your Salary Certificate? It's Probably the Arabic."

**Pain point:** Mortgage and loan applicants get salary certificates rejected by banks because they're not in Arabic, or the Arabic translation doesn't match the bank's required format.

**Source:** DMCC guidelines require bilingual salary certificates for government submission. MyBayut: "no Dubai bank will process your mortgage application" without proper documentation. Banks reject certificates addressed "To Whom It May Concern" instead of the specific bank.

5. Close: "Tell us the bank. We'll format it right."

**Fact-check items:**
- [ ] Verify DMCC bilingual certificate requirements
